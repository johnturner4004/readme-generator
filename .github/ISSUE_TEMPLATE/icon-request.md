What type of icon are you requesting? (technology/license)

What is it's name?

Does [Devicon](https://github.com/devicons/devicon) have an icon for it and if so please include the link?

If Devicon does not have an icon have you found another one that could be used? Svg images are preferred and images must be licensed for public use.

Do you have a link to the technology's/license's documentation or some other information source(like [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) with code documentation or tutorials for technologies or license information for licenses? Please include link.

Approximately how frequently will you use this icon (used to prioritize multiple icon requests)?

Thank you for helping make this project better.
