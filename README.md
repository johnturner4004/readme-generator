## Description

This app is to help people easily make more informative and nicer looking readme. files for their projects. The checkboxes for the technologies used are also links to either the documentation for the language/framework or some instructional source for it.

## Getting Started

This project should be able to run in the  your favorite IDE. I used VS code while making it but any should work. If you would simple. like to use the README.md Generator without reproducing the whole project, a deployed version of this app is available at https://johnturner4004.github.io/readme-generator/. 

To request new features, technologies, or licenses please open an issue and enter as much detail as you can. If you are requesting additional technologies or licenses, I will get it up faster if you include the link to the icon and the documentation for the language. For the icons, icons from [devicon](https://github.com/devicons/devicon) are preferred but if none are available please find a svg logo for the language.

### Prerequisites

1. Install [brew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)
2. install Node.js by typing ```brew install node``` in your terminal

### Installation

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/johnturner4004/readme-generator)
2. Copy the link to clone if from the code button in the repo's page.
3. In your terminal type ```git clone {paste repo link}```
4. Navigate into the repo's folder in your terminal by typing ```cd ./readme-generator```
5. Type ```npm install``` to install it's dependencies.
6. Type ```npm start```

## Usage

Once installed and running it should open in your default browser but if not navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You can also use the deployed [version](https://johnturner4004.github.io/readme-generator) if you want but any changes you make to the code will not be reflected there. 

The app was designed to be easy to use. Simply fill in the boxes and check off the technologies and license you used and it makes the markdown file for you. with a preview you can see. The code is updated whenever you click a checkbox or license or whenever you tab or click out of one of the text boxes. Once finished simply copy the markdown code below this form on the left side of the page and past it into your readme file. If you do not have one make a new file in the root directory of your project called README.md, past the code into it, and save it.

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to extend a special thanks to [Devicon.dev](https://devicon.dev/) for the amazing collection of icons they have made available to the programming community. 

[Shield.io](https://shields.io/) was also used to make the badges on the top of the readme's generated using this app. I would encourage anyone who uses this to also give them a shoutout in your acknowledgements.

I'd also like to thank [Prime Digital Academy](https://www.primeacademy.io/) for teaching me how to program. I strongly recommend them to anyone in either the Twin Cities or Kansas City area looking to start a career in programming or user experience.

Finally, I'd like to thank the Hendrickson and Turner families for their financial and emotional support throughout my journey into software development.
